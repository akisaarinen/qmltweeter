Pure QML
========

Animated loading indicator for tweets
-------------------------------------

* An animated rotating loading indicator that is shown when
  the tweets are being refreshed
* http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/qml-image.html
* An image available at "/img/ajax-loader.gif"

Update-button to refresh current search results
-----------------------------------------------

1) Implement as inline QML
* http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/qml-mousearea.html

2) Implement as a named QML component 'Button'
* Create a new QML component named 'Button' in qml/Button.qml 
  (remember to add it as a resource, too!)
* Define the following properties:
    - text => Text to display in the button
    - textColor => Color of the text
* Emit a 'clicked' -signal when button is clicked
* Use the created Button -component to refresh the
  current tweet search with latest results from Twitter

QML and C++
===============================================

Saving of current search term over application restarts
-------------------------------------------------------

* When application is started, current search term is loaded from
  persistent property file. Whenever use enters new search term, the current
  search term is saved to be used after next restart.
* See http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/qdeclarativecontext.html,
  especially #contextProperty() and #setContextProperty()
* QML and C++ interoperability: http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/qtbinding.html
