Pure QML
========

Animated loading indicator for tweets
-------------------------------------

* An animated rotating loading indicator that is shown when
  the tweets are being refreshed
* http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/qml-image.html
* An image available at "/img/ajax-loader.gif"

Update-button to refresh current search results
-----------------------------------------------

1) Implement as inline QML
* http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/qml-mousearea.html

2) Implement as a named QML component 'Button'
* Create a new QML component named 'Button' in qml/Button.qml 
  (remember to add it as a resource, too!)
* Define the following properties:
    - text => Text to display in the button
    - textColor => Color of the text
* Emit a 'clicked' -signal when button is clicked
* Use the created Button -component to refresh the
  current tweet search with latest results from Twitter

Throttled continuous search
---------------------------

1) Implement a throttled continuous search
* Easy version: search 500ms after user has stopped typing
* Hard version: search every 500ms even when user is typing
* http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/qml-timer.html
* To keep focus correct, wrap the component to FocusScope. See examples at 
  http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/qdeclarativefocus.html#acquiring-focus-and-focus-scopes

2) Extract to QML component named 'ThrottledTextInput'
* An example of text input component available at http://jryannel.wordpress.com/2010/02/18/a-textinput-component/
* Define the following properties
    - throttleInterval (interval in ms)
    - throttledText (current text with throttling enabled)
    - text (current text)
* Use for automated search by binding to throttledTextChanged -property
    - QML will emit this automatically when throttledText -property
      is changed

Splash screen
-------------

Implement an animated splash screen when the application starts.

Fancy graphics to about box
---------------------------

Implement something fancy in the about box e.g. with the particle engine or
create fancy transitions from main view to about box etc.

QML and C++
===============================================

Saving of current search term over application restarts
-------------------------------------------------------

* When application is started, current search term is loaded from
  persistent property file. Whenever use enters new search term, the current
  search term is saved to be used after next restart.
* See http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/qdeclarativecontext.html,
  especially #contextProperty() and #setContextProperty()
* QML and C++ interoperability: http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/qtbinding.html
