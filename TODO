- Better throttling: search every 500ms instead of waiting
  until the user has stopped typing => more responsive UI
- Search history & auto-completion?
- Clicking of @user -links in tweets to do searchs based on 
  that user and show some user info
- Clicking of links in tweets by launching the integrated
  WebKit-browser (requires some work because the default
  WebKit-component is quite dumb)
