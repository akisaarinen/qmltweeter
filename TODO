- Search history & auto-completion (will require some saving
  to local filesystem and hence some C++ integration)
- Clicking of @user -links in tweets to do searchs based on 
  that user and show some user info
- Clicking of links in tweets by launching the integrated
  WebKit-browser (requires some work because the default
  WebKit-component is quite dumb)
